frontend:

npm create vite@latest .
npm install
npm run dev

Why is Vite better?
1️⃣ Super fast - Loads only what’s needed instead of bundling everything.
2️⃣ Instant updates - See changes immediately without waiting.
3️⃣ Works with React, Vue, and more - No extra setup needed.
4️⃣ Smaller, faster production builds - Your website runs efficiently.

It’s like upgrading from a slow bicycle (Webpack) to a super-fast electric bike (Vite)! 

Vite is a build tool, not a framework.

What does that mean?
It helps you develop and build web applications faster.
It does not provide UI components like React or Vue (those are frameworks).
It’s mainly used to serve and bundle your code efficiently.
Think of it like this:
If React is the engine, Vite is the turbocharger that makes it run faster! 🚀

What is nodemon?
nodemon is a tool that automatically restarts your Node.js application whenever you make changes to your code.

🔹 Without nodemon → You have to manually restart your server after every change.
🔹 With nodemon → It watches your files and restarts the server automatically.

What does -D mean?
-D stands for --save-dev, which means:

It installs nodemon as a development dependency (only needed while coding, not in production).
It gets listed under "devDependencies" in package.json.

============================================================================

index .js will have the middle ware so al, the requests for api/auth/...
redirected to authRoutes function

authRoutes function imported from the routes folder from aut.route.js file
here just write the http method and the endpoints like
/login ,/logout,/signup (i.e: api/auth/signup)

for these api functions got from controllers from auth.controllers.js
=======================================================================

What is a .env File?
A .env file (short for environment file) is used to store secret or configuration values separately from your code.

Why Use .env?
✔ Keeps secrets safe → Stores API keys, database URLs, and sensitive data securely.
✔ Easy configuration → Change values without modifying code.
✔ Avoids hardcoding → Prevents exposing secrets in public repositories (GitHub).
